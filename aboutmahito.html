                     Mahito is a powerful, <br> special grade cursed spirit in Jujutsu Kaisen, known for his <br> manipulative nature and ability to alter souls. He embodies <br> human hatred and resentment, born from the negative emotions <br>humans feel towards each other. His cursed technique, Idle <br>Transfiguration, allows him to reshape the souls of others,<br> twisting their bodies and minds.
